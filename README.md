# CodeReady Containers - OpenShift 4 on your Laptop Â 
This project is focused on bringing a minimal [OpenShift 4.0 or newer](http://github.com/openshift/origin) cluster to your local laptop or desktop computer. 

If you are looking for a solution for running OpenShift 3.x, you will need tools such as `oc cluster up`, [Minishift](http://github.com/minishift/minishift) or [CDK](https://developers.redhat.com/products/cdk/overview/).
